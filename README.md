Inferring protein dynamics from an unordered "bag" of equilibrium conformations. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques may be effective in estimating the stochastic matrix describing transition probabilities.

Calmodulin and FsPeptide datasets were first used by Pande et. al on their work on Markov State Models.
